## Calls for conferences, papers, and award nominations

- The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is now available for applications for the 2023 awards. Interested students should begin at the applicant information page <http://www.nsfgrfp.org> . The GRFP supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. The program provides up to three years of graduate education support, including an annual $37,000 stipend. Applications for Mathematical Sciences topics are due October 21, 2022. US citizens and permanent residents who are planning to enter graduate school in fall 2023 are eligible (as are those in the first two years of such a graduate program, or who are returning to graduate school after being out for two or more years). The program solicitation NSF 22-614 (<http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201> ) contains full details. See also the GRFP FAQ document NSF 21-109 (<https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21109/nsf21109.pdf>).
- The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) offers NSF-AWM Mentoring Travel Grants for Women whose objective is to help junior women to develop long-term working and mentoring relationships with senior mathematicians. This relationship should help the junior mathematicians to establish their research programs and eventually receive tenure. Each grant funds travel, accommodations, and other required expenses for an untenured woman mathematician to travel to an institute or a department to do research with a specified individual for one month. A maximum of $5000 per award will be funded. See the website for eligibility and other details. Applications are due February 15.

## External Webinar Announcements 

-  The ASA Section for Statistical Programmers and Analysts invites you to join the free zoom webinar on Introduction to Quarto Reports and Notebooks: Literate Computing in R, Python, or Julia. 
    * Time: Friday, October 21, 2022, 8AM – 9PM Pacific / 9AM – 10AM Mountain / 10AM – 11AM Central / 11AM – 12PM Eastern
Registration Page: udayton.zoom.us/meeting/register/... 
    * Audience: R, Python, and Julia users who want to learn the next generation of RMarkdown and/or Jupyter Notebooks
    * Jupyter and RMarkdown have been the standard for open-source and reproducible data analysis reports for years. Quarto doesn't change that, but builds on top of their ideals. Quarto is an 'open-source scientific and technical publishing system' which uses Pandoc to interleave code and output from R/Python/Julia with Markdown and LaTeX commentary into a single, high-quality report in MS Word, PDF, or HTML formats. This presentation will be a brief (and non-technical) introduction to Quarto. If you would like to follow along, please install the latest version of RStudio (for R users: www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download), or install Quarto directly (for Python/Julia users: quarto.org/docs/get-started). 
    
- The ASA Statistical Consulting Section and Pathways to Promotion Committee is offering a free webinar open to all (members and non-members).
