Interested students should begin at the applicant information page <http://www.nsfgrfp.org> . The GRFP supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. The program provides up to three years of graduate education support, including an annual $37,000 stipend. Applications for Mathematical Sciences topics are due October 21, 2022. US citizens and permanent residents who are planning to enter graduate school in fall 2023 are eligible (as are those in the first two years of such a graduate program, or who are returning to graduate school after being out for two or more years). The program solicitation NSF 22-614 (<http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201> ) contains full details. See also the GRFP FAQ document NSF 21-109 (<https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21109/nsf21109.pdf>).\n- The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) offers NSF-AWM Mentoring Travel Grants for Women whose objective is to help junior women to develop long-term working and mentoring relationships with senior mathematicians. This relationship should help the junior mathematicians to establish their research programs and eventually receive tenure. Each grant funds travel, accommodations, and other required expenses for an untenured woman mathematician to travel to an institute or a department to do research with a specified individual for one month. A maximum of $5000 per award will be funded. See the website for eligibility and other details. Applications are due February 15.\n- The International Statistical Institute (ISI) is now calling for contributed paper/poster sessions (CPS) for their World Statistics Congress 2023 in Ottawa Canada (July 16-20, 2023). Abstract submissions are due by November 21, 2022. See the conference link for details and to submit. Guidelines for CPS presenters are provided here.\n- The NBER Working Group on Race and Stratification in the Economy invites papers for potential presentation at its third annual conference.  The meeting will highlight research on the economics of race and stratification economics. It will consider factors that contribute to racial differences in income, wealth, housing, educational attainment, labor market outcomes, economic mobility, and a range of other measures. The conference will be held in hybrid format on March 31, 2023, with an in-person component in Cambridge, Massachusetts, if public health conditions permit, and a virtual component as well. The NBER welcomes submissions by scholars who are early in their careers, who are not NBER affiliates, and/or who are members of under-represented groups. To be considered for inclusion on the program, completed papers must be uploaded by 11:59pm (EST) on Friday, December 16, 2022, via the following link: <https://conference.nber.org/confsubmit/backend/cfp?id=RSs23> . Questions about this conference may be addressed to <confer@nber.org>.
