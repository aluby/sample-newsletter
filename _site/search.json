Quarto doesn’t change that, but builds on top of their ideals. Quarto is an ‘open-source scientific and technical publishing system’ which uses Pandoc to interleave code and output from R/Python/Julia with Markdown and LaTeX commentary into a single, high-quality report in MS Word, PDF, or HTML formats. This presentation will be a brief (and non-technical) introduction to Quarto. If you would like to follow along, please install the latest version of RStudio (for R users: www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download), or install Quarto directly (for Python/Julia users: quarto.org/docs/get-started).\n\nThe ASA Statistical Consulting Section and Pathways to Promotion Committee is offering a free webinar open to all (members and non-members).\n\nTitle: The Art of Negotiating: Growing Your Influence Through Power Skills\nDate: October 27th, 12:00-1:30 PM ET/ 9-10:30am PT\nSpeakers: Dr. Adrian Coles (fellow JEDI), Dr. Leah J.

    "text": "External Webinar Announcements\n\nThe ASA Section for Statistical Programmers and Analysts invites you to join the free zoom webinar on Introduction to Quarto Reports and Notebooks: Literate Computing in R, Python, or Julia.\n\nTime: Friday, October 21, 2022, 8AM – 9PM Pacific / 9AM – 10AM Mountain / 10AM – 11AM Central / 11AM – 12PM Eastern Registration Page: udayton.zoom.us/meeting/register/…\nAudience: R, Python, and Julia users who want to learn the next generation of RMarkdown and/or Jupyter Notebooks\nJupyter and RMarkdown have been the standard for open-source and reproducible data analysis reports for years. Quarto doesn’t change that, but builds on top of their ideals. Quarto is an ‘open-source scientific and technical publishing system’ which uses Pandoc to interleave code and output from R/Python/Julia with Markdown and LaTeX commentary into a single, high-quality report in MS Word, PDF, or HTML formats. This presentation will be a brief (and non-technical) introduction to Quarto. If you would like to follow along, please install the latest version of RStudio (for R users: www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download), or install Quarto directly (for Python/Julia users: quarto.org/docs/get-started).\n\nThe ASA Statistical Consulting Section and Pathways to Promotion Committee is offering a free webinar open to all (members and non-members).\n\nTitle: The Art of Negotiating: Growing Your Influence Through Power Skills\nDate: October 27th, 12:00-1:30 PM ET/ 9-10:30am PT\nSpeakers: Dr. Adrian Coles (fellow JEDI), Dr. Leah J. Welty and Ms. Michiko I. Wolcott\nPlease join us for advice from our speakers and a panel discussion. Learn tips on how to negotiate in different aspects by power skills in order to establish a successful collaborative career.
